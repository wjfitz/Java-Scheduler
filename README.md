# Java-Scheduler
I wrote this during a very stressful and busy couple of weeks of balancing schoolwork with a full time job. I used it to plan out my days
and keep track of my schoolwork.

I wrote it with my only target user in mind: me. So it's messy, there's little documentation, and basically no error handling.
